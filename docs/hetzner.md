# Hetzner Configuration

To use Hetzner as a provider, you'll need to generate an API token.

## Steps

1. Login to your [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/).
2. Select your project (or create a new one).
3. Go to Security > API Tokens.
4. Click "Generate API Token".
5. Enter a token name (e.g., "CloudProxy").
6. Select "Read & Write" for the permission.
7. Click "Generate API Token".
8. Copy the token immediately (it will only be displayed once).

## Dynamic Credential Management

In addition to configuring credentials via environment variables (detailed below), you can now manage Hetzner credentials dynamically using the CloudProxy API. This allows you to add, list, and remove Hetzner accounts on the fly without restarting the application.

To add a Hetzner credential via the API, you will typically need to provide:
- `instance_id`: A unique name for this credential instance (e.g., `my-hetzner-account1`).
- `provider`: Set to `hetzner`.
- `secrets`: A dictionary containing:
    - `api_token`: Your Hetzner API token.

Example API payload to add a Hetzner credential:
```json
{
  "instance_id": "hetzner-default",
  "provider": "hetzner",
  "secrets": {
    "api_token": "YOUR_HETZNER_API_TOKEN"
  }
}
```

For more details on using the API for credential management, please refer to the [API Documentation](./api.md#credential-management).

Now you have your token, you can use Hetzner as a proxy provider by configuring the environment variables as shown below.

## Configuration options
### Environment variables:
#### Required:
``HETZNER_ENABLED`` - to enable Hetzner as a provider, set as True. Default value: False

``HETZNER_API_TOKEN`` - the API token to allow CloudProxy access to your account.

#### Optional:
``HETZNER_MIN_SCALING`` - the minimum number of proxies to provision. Default value: 2

``HETZNER_MAX_SCALING`` - currently unused, but will be when autoscaling is implemented. We recommend you set this to the same value as the minimum scaling to avoid future issues. Default value: 2

``HETZNER_SIZE`` - the server type to use. Default value: cx11 (the smallest available server type)

``HETZNER_LOCATION`` - the location where the server will be deployed. Default value: nbg1 (Nuremberg, Germany)

``HETZNER_DATACENTER`` - alternatively, you can specify a specific datacenter rather than just a location. Note that a datacenter value will override the location setting.

## Multi-Account Support

CloudProxy supports running multiple Hetzner accounts simultaneously. Each account is configured as a separate "instance" with its own settings.

### Default Instance Configuration

The configuration variables mentioned above configure the "default" instance. For example:

```
HETZNER_ENABLED=True
HETZNER_API_TOKEN=your_default_token
HETZNER_LOCATION=nbg1
HETZNER_MIN_SCALING=2
```

### Additional Instances Configuration

To configure additional Hetzner accounts, use the following format:
```
HETZNER_INSTANCENAME_VARIABLE=VALUE
```

For example, to add a second Hetzner account in a different location:

```
HETZNER_FINLAND_ENABLED=True
HETZNER_FINLAND_API_TOKEN=your_second_token
HETZNER_FINLAND_LOCATION=hel1
HETZNER_FINLAND_MIN_SCALING=3
HETZNER_FINLAND_SIZE=cx11
HETZNER_FINLAND_DISPLAY_NAME=Finland Hetzner Account
```

### Available instance-specific configurations

For each instance, you can configure:

#### Required for each instance:
- `HETZNER_INSTANCENAME_ENABLED` - to enable this specific instance
- `HETZNER_INSTANCENAME_API_TOKEN` - the API token for this instance

#### Optional for each instance:
- `HETZNER_INSTANCENAME_MIN_SCALING` - minimum number of proxies for this instance
- `HETZNER_INSTANCENAME_MAX_SCALING` - maximum number of proxies for this instance
- `HETZNER_INSTANCENAME_SIZE` - server type for this instance
- `HETZNER_INSTANCENAME_LOCATION` - location for this instance
- `HETZNER_INSTANCENAME_DATACENTER` - datacenter for this instance (overrides location)
- `HETZNER_INSTANCENAME_DISPLAY_NAME` - a friendly name for the instance that will appear in the UI

Each instance operates independently, maintaining its own pool of proxies according to its configuration.
